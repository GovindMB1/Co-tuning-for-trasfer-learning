Co-tuning is a transfer learning approach that combines feature extraction and relationship learning tasks to enhance the performance of deep neural networks. This project presents the application of co-tuning in a project utilizing the PyTorch framework. The methodology involves training a ResNet50-based model on the CUB-200 dataset for fine-grained image classification. The key steps include importing the required libraries, preprocessing the dataset, defining the model architecture, computing the relationship matrix, and conducting a training loop with a trade-off parameter for balancing feature extraction and classification. The model's performance is evaluated using a validation set and TenCropsTest approach on the test set. Logging and saving mechanisms are implemented for monitoring and storing relevant information. The proposed methodology showcases the effectiveness of co-tuning for improving transfer learning outcomes and achieving accurate classification results in fine-grained image recognition tasks.
